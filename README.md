# Synthetic-Patient-Health-Data-Generation-Using-Conversational-AI-and-Large-Language-Models

This GitHub repository holds the research work focusing on generating synthetic tabular data using DPC-GANs combined Large Language Model Lamma 2(shraded version).

Advanced generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their capability in creating realistic synthetic patient records, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), CT scans, EEG, and ECG data. These models utilize real-world patient data to simulate and produce synthetic data that closely mirrors the statistical and structural properties of the original data. However, these models are heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data and face limitations in generating synthetic data that significantly diverges from the input. Additionally, there are technical barriers that make it challenging for domain experts, such as health researchers, doctors, or clinicians, to effectively use these models in their practice. These models typically do not accommodate direct human input for generating or modifying synthetic data.

In response to these challenges, this project aims to develop a conversational AI tool capable of
incorporating human input to generate synthetic patient health data. Our approach for this research project will begin with the selection of The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) which is a large database consisting of 26 publicly available tables, made up of classified medical information from more than 40,000 patients in critical care. A vast variety of data is included in the collection, containing patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, prescription drugs, diagnoses and notes from medical proceduresThe suggested approach combines LLM model LlaMA-2 Chat-7B-HF with DPC-GANsfor patient EHR data. This tool would enable healthcare professionals to make specific requests, such as ‚Äúgenerate 2000 Type 2 diabetes patients EHR data with 20 important diabetes observations based on the US population‚Äù or inquire about the sources of real-world data and guidelines used for synthesizing data. This approach seeks to make generative models more accessible and practical for healthcare professionals, bridging the gap between complex AI technologies and everyday clinical applications.


Code Reproducibility

To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we have organized the code under the 'Notebooks' section. Each notebook runs on Google Colaboratory and within this section corresponds to a singular experiment, allowing for an in-depth review of our findings. Navigating into 'Notebook' section you will find the code on how we trained DP_GANs, the preprocess of our final dataset, the fine tuning of our LLM model, the evaluation of generated synthetic data and the evaluation of the final results. The 'Final_datasets' folder, located under 'Notebooks,' includes two different chapter files. After splitting the whole dataset into different chapters we chose 4 and 6 csv files for training and generating synthetic data. Finally you can also have a look at 'Supervisor Notes' that we took as a group during different phases with out supervisor.
