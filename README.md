# Synthetic-Patient-Health-Data-Generation-Using-Conversational-AI-and-Large-Language-Models

This GitHub repository holds the research work focusing on generating synthetic tabular data using DPC-GANs combined
Large Language Model Lamma 2(shraded version)

*Abstract:* 
Advanced generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models have
demonstrated their capability in creating realistic synthetic patient records, including Electronic Health
Records (EHR), CT scans, EEG, and ECG data. These models utilize real-world patient data to simulate and
produce synthetic data that closely mirrors the statistical and structural properties of the original data.
However, these models are heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data and face
limitations in generating synthetic data that significantly diverges from the input. Additionally, there are
technical barriers that make it challenging for domain experts, such as health researchers, doctors, or
clinicians, to effectively use these models in their practice. These models typically do not accommodate
direct human input for generating or modifying synthetic data.

In response to these challenges, this project aims to develop a conversational AI tool capable of
incorporating human input to generate synthetic patient health data. The suggested approach combines
LLM model LlaMA-2 Chat-7B-HF with DPC-GANs for patient EHR data. This tool would enable
healthcare professionals to make specific requests, such as ‚Äúgenerate 2000 Type 2 diabetes patients EHR
data with 20 important diabetes observations based on the US population‚Äù or inquire about the sources of
real-world data and guidelines used for synthesizing data. This approach seeks to make generative models
more accessible and practical for healthcare professionals, bridging the gap between complex AI
technologies and everyday clinical applications.
